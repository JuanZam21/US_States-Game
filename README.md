# U.S. States Game

## Description

The U.S. States Game is an interactive Python game designed to test and improve your knowledge of the United States' geography. Using the Turtle graphics library, this game prompts the user to name all 50 states, displaying each correctly guessed state on a blank map of the U.S.

## Features

- Interactive text input for guessing state names.
- Visual feedback for correct guesses by displaying the state name on the map.
- Informative prompt displaying the number of correctly guessed states out of 50.
- Encouragement messages for repeated states or upon completing the game.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3 installed on your machine.
- The `turtle` and `pandas` Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

- pip install turtle
- pip install pandas

- The game requires a CSV file named `50_states.csv` containing the states' names and their corresponding coordinates on the map.
- A GIF image named `blank_states_img.gif` representing a blank map of the U.S.

## How to Play

1. Start the game by running the Python script.
2. An input box will appear, prompting you to type the name of a U.S. state.
3. If your guess is correct, the state name will appear on its corresponding location on the map.
4. The title of the input box will show the number of correctly guessed states.
5. The game continues until all 50 states are correctly named or the game window is closed.

## How to Install

1. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required `50_states.csv` and `blank_states_img.gif` files in the same directory as the script.
